##Here is my Cussin Weather App
Basically, its an app that wants to swear but just pushes the boundaries with the uncountable alternatives.
It gets straight to the point and gets your location and provides you with a color to generally associate with the weather at the time. Bright and warm, or dark and gloomy. 
Later, I'm planning to go in and further this more! I'm not sure how but, I believe there are PLENTY of cool things I could do to make this even better! Design is truly never done. Especially with me.
